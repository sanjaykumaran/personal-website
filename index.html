      A bit about me, I am a passionate Software Developer. I love to solve
      problems and create new solutions with code. I have also been featured on
      Forbes along with winning the Forbes 30 Under 30 Award for my games. Along
      with winning both TAMU hack-a-thons this year! I hope to get an
      opportunity to work along with a revered Microsoft Engineering team to
      solve problems and make an Impact!
